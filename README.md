This plot is a tool to display the relationship between multiple socio-demographic variables and multiple health risk factors where each circle represents each US state. The [dataset](D3_data_journalism/assets/data/data.csv) is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and includes rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc.

### Script Summary
